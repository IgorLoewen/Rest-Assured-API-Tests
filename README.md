# Sprint_7

## Project Description

The **Sprint_7** project is a learning project designed for API testing automation, utilizing the following technologies:

- **JUnit 4**: For writing and running unit tests.
- **RestAssured**: For testing REST APIs.
- **Allure**: For generating detailed test reports.
- **Maven**: For dependency management and build automation.

## Project Structure

- **`src/test/java/`**: Contains test classes.
- **`target/allure-results/`**: Temporary files generated by Allure for report creation.

## Requirements

- **Java 11** or higher
- **Maven 3.6** or higher
- Installed **Allure** (to run the `allure serve` command)

## How to Run Tests

1. **Using IntelliJ IDEA**:
   - Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Right-click on the test class or method you want to execute and select "Run".

2. **Using the Command Line**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean test
   ```

## Generating Allure Report

1. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   mvn clean test
   ```

2. Generate the Allure report:
   ```bash
   mvn allure:report
   ```

3. To view the report locally:
   ```bash
   mvn allure:serve
   ```

If you need to force push the Allure results:
```bash
git add -f ./target/allure-results/
```

# Repository Description

This repository contains a project for testing the REST API of the Yandex Scooter service. The main branches are:

### Branches

- **main**: The main branch containing the approved and stable code.
- **feature/lombok**: An alternative version of the project where the **Lombok** library is used to simplify the data class (DTO, POJO) implementation.
   - **Features**:
      - Automatic generation of getters, setters, constructors, and other methods using annotations.
      - Cleaner and more maintainable code.
      - All data classes use annotations like `@Data`, `@AllArgsConstructor`, etc.

### Using the Lombok Library

Lombok is utilized to:
- Simplify the management of data objects.
- Reduce boilerplate code (e.g., getters, setters, constructors, `toString`, etc.).
- Improve code readability and maintainability.

**Example with Lombok:**
```java
@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class CourierModel {
    private String login;
    private String password;
    private String firstName;
}
```

# API Description

## Task Details

This project involves testing the API of the Yandex Scooter educational service. You can find the API documentation here:  
[API Documentation](https://qa-scooter.praktikum-services.ru/docs/).  
The main service can be accessed at:  
[Service Link](https://qa-scooter.praktikum-services.ru/).

### Steps and Tasks

1. **Manual Testing in Postman**:
   - Familiarize yourself with the API and its requests by testing endpoints manually in Postman.

2. **Endpoints to Test**:

   - **Courier Creation**:
      - Validate that a courier can be created successfully.
      - Ensure that creating duplicate couriers is not allowed.
      - Verify that all required fields must be provided for creating a courier.
      - Check that the correct status codes and responses are returned.

   - **Courier Login**:
      - Ensure that a courier can log in with valid credentials.
      - Validate that all required fields must be provided for login.
      - Verify errors are returned for incorrect login or password.
      - Check the response when logging in as a non-existent user.
      - Ensure successful login returns a valid `id`.

   - **Order Creation**:
      - Validate order creation with different color combinations:
         - Only "BLACK".
         - Only "GREY".
         - Both "BLACK" and "GREY".
         - No color specified.
      - Ensure the response contains a `track` ID.

   - **Order List**:
      - Validate that the response body contains a list of orders.

3. **Allure Report**:
   - Generate a comprehensive Allure report and push it to the repository for review.
